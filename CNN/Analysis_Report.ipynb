        "This report analyzes the performance differences between a standard CNN (Unweighted) and a Class-Weighted CNN (Weighted) on the plant disease classification task. \n",
        "\n",
        "**Key Findings:**\n",
        "- **The Unweighted model outperforms the Weighted model** in overall Accuracy (**79.25%** vs 77.81%) and Macro F1 (**0.78** vs 0.77).\n",
        "- **Weighted Loss Trade-off:** While the weighted loss function successfully improved Recall for minority classes (+1.64%), it caused a disproportionate drop in precision for those same classes (-1.86%) and significantly degraded the performance on majority classes (Recall -7.50%).\n",
        "- **Conclusion:** The class weighting strategy was overly aggressive, introducing false positives in minority classes and underfitting the dominant majority classes, leading to a net negative impact on global metrics."
